# Flask_plotly_examples
Create a simple web application that derdisplays a Plotly chart. For instance, create a Flask route that rendres a template containing a Plotly chart, with data dynamically generated from a Python function
Here's a brief description of what such an example might involve:

    Initialization: Initialize a Flask application.
    Data Preparation: Write Python code to prepare data for your Plotly chart. This could involve generating sample data or fetching data from a database or an external API.
    Chart Creation: Use Plotly to create an interactive chart based on the prepared data.
    Web Interface: Define a Flask route that renders an HTML template containing the Plotly chart.
    HTML Template: Create an HTML template that includes a placeholder for the Plotly chart.
    Integration: Render the Plotly chart in the HTML template using Plotly's JavaScript library.
    Deployment: Run the Flask application, making it accessible via a local server or deploying it to a web server for online access.
