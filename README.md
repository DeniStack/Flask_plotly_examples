Welcome to My Python App with Dash and Plotly!
Introduction

Welcome to my modern and interactive Python app built using Dash components and Plotly for creating beautiful charts. This app allows you to visualize data and interact with it in real-time, providing an immersive user experience.
Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the app on your local machine:

    Get the Requirements: Make sure you have all the necessary dependencies installed by checking the requirements.txt file.

    index.py: In your index.py file, add the path to your new app.

    nav.py: Update your navigation menu in the nav.py file to include your app as a card.

    mssql_queries.py: If you're using a database, add your SQL queries in the mssql_queries.py file.

    mssql_config.ini: Configure your database connection settings in the mssql_config.ini file.

    constants.py: If you need to define any constants for your app, add them to the constants.py file.

    app.py: Change the name of your app in the app.py file to match your project.

    Add Data: If your app requires initial data, make sure to add it to the users.csv file.

    Run the App: Open your command line interface and navigate to the directory where your app is located. Then, run python index.py to start the app.

Usage

Once the app is running, navigate to your app location in your web browser. You should see your app's interface, where you can interact with the data and explore the visualizations generated by Plotly.
